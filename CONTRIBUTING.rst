Hello! And thanks for reading our contributing page, which hopefully means you're considering contributing to the repo somehow. Contributions to the repo can take several forms, such as:

 * Code contributions
 * Documentation
 * Bug reports
 * Feature requests
 * Probably more


Our policy regarding changes to the code or documentation in the repo is that it must be through a Pull Request, and that said Pull Request must be reviewed by one of our maintainers.


To contribute code to this project, 

 * clone the repository
 * set up a virtual environment
 * install requirements.txt
 * make your changes
 * ensure tests pass
 * if you add new code, make sure you write new tests to cover the new code
 * create a PR and fill out the PR template


If the maintainers/reviewers have questions, they will comment on your PR or inline in the PR diffs. If they have questions, please answer them as soon as possible to help ensure that the PR is accepted (or rejected) in a timely manner. If the maintainers ask questions and do not hear back for several months, they may decide to close the PR without merging.

We will try to keep a list of known bugs / desired features / vision for future development of the library, so if you're looking to make a contribution, check for these first. Otherwise, we will accept general changes as needed.



If you have questions or want to get in touch with one of the project's maintainers, email tech.team@industrydive.com
